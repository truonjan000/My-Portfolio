### Computer Science II

**October 11th**

For Computer Science II so far, I am learning the Javascript computer language. 
You must have a file that could run another file by coordinating it. For example, I created a hello.html file. This coordinates the folder that has the file I would like to run. 

![hello_html](/hello_html.png)

From this, I created another called sketch.js. This shows the actual code of what I wanted to make. You can run this file in from the hello.html. The first time I started with learning how to program shapes, such as; circles, triangles, lines, points, etc. I also learned to add color to my shapes and background. I've created a turtle as a product with what I learned.

In the second assignment, I learned about how to use mouse interactivity to create beautiful patterns. I learned about the use of the "on click" command. I was able to use my previous knowledge about lines, points, and colors to construct this abstract art with an addition of mouse interactivity.

In the third assignment, I learned about the use of mouse interactivity in certain regions. In specific regions, when you clicked on a color they would use that color to draw. I created a generated four blocks of colors in the colors for the user to choose from. The user is abke to paint based on their own choice of color out of the ones provided.

In the fourth assignment, using my knowledge of shapes and colors, I added images using loops. The pictures were put into a loop so that it was on top of the circles that were also part of the loop.

This is one of the games that I made using p5.js. This ame includes mouse interactivity and colors. It was one of the games that was used for my semester project. It was embedded into a map for a whole game. The code for this game is in the link below:

This was another game that I made using p5.js. It was used for a part of my semester project. This one is different from the one before, because it emphasizes on another country tradition. It is also embedded into a map using leaflet. The code that was used to program this is in the link below:

You can run both of the codes using this link. Change the file name to run that program:

So far this semester, we have been playing around with D3.js. This a JavaScript library that is used for visualizing data. The first easy task was to create a simple bar graph. There were some simple steps to change the color, and it gave a broad understanding of how the code is run to make the bar graph. This basic understanding helped foster the understanding of position.

_Above is a picture of the simple bar graph. Under, is the code that will run the code for the simple bar graph._

Going on with D3.js, I was able to investigate even more and further the complexity of my code. With this, I was able to create a more advanced bar graph with my own data, use tooltip, duration, margins, generated axises, and change of colors.

[Code 2]()

_Above is a picture of the more complex bar graph. Under, is the code that can run the bar graph shown._

I think that the skills that got from completing this task will really help me in my future projects. I thought it was really cool to know that I made a sort of "animated" graph. However, the worst part of this was, it took a lot of tries. Mostly when coding, you'll almost never get on the first try. There will always be some type of error. The hard thing is, it could be the smallest things that you didn't think you would mess up on. For example, misspelling something, putting the semicolon in the wrong place, or even having excess parenthesis, quotations, or brackets. This semester was the first time I didn't rely on someone else to code. I remember in Computer Science I, I would need a lot of help from a partner to code with python. Especially when we watched videos together, because they were hard to grasp on our own. However, this semester, I was able to watch the videos on my own and code by myself, and even helped my partner out. I think that was a big accomplishment.
