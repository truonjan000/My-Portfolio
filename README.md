###Computer Science II

**October 11th**
For Computer Science II so far, I am learning the Javascript computer language. 
You must have a file that could run another file by coordinating it. For example, I created a hello.html file. This coordinates the folder that has the file I would like to run. 

![hello_html](/hello_html.png)

From this, I created another called sketch.js. This shows the actual code of what I wanted to make. You can run this file in from the hello.html. The first time I started with learning how to program shapes, such as; circles, triangles, lines, points, etc. I also learned to add color to my shapes and background. I've created a turtle as a product with what I learned.

In the second assignment, I learned about how to use mouse interactivity to create beautiful patterns. I learned about the use of the "on click" command. I was able to use my previous knowledge about lines, points, and colors to construct this abstract art with an addition of mouse interactivity.

In the third assignment, I learned about the use of mouse interactivity in certain regions. In specific regions, when you clicked on a color they would use that color to draw. I created a generated four blocks of colors in the colors for the user to choose from. The user is abke to paint based on their own choice of color out of the ones provided.

In the fourth assignment, using my knowledge of shapes and colors, I added images using loops. The pictures were put into a loop so that it was on top of the circles that were also part of the loop.

This is one of the games that I made using p5.js. This ame includes mouse interactivity and colors. It was one of the games that was used for my semester project. It was embedded into a map for a whole game. The code for this game is in the link below:

This was another game that I made using p5.js. It was used for a part of my semester project. This one is different from the one before, because it emphasizes on another country tradition. It is also embedded into a map using leaflet. The code that was used to program this is in the link below:

You can run both of the codes using this link:
